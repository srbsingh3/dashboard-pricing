# Portfolio & Interview Guidelines

---

## Wolt

**Position:** Senior Product Designer

To effectively showcase your product design expertise, Wolt recommends the following:

### Structured Presentation
Present your work with clear storytelling. Use slides or Figma to guide us visually through your design decisions. Walk us through the story of your work using actual screens and design artefacts. Think of it as narrating your thinking through design, rather than relying on text.

### Range & Depth
Select case studies that highlight not only your design craft, but also your problem-solving skills, design choices, and the impact of your work. Show variety across different challenges, platforms, or user needs, as well as moments where you went deep on a specific problem.

### Craft & Attention to Detail
Demonstrate a strong eye for visual design — clear hierarchy, thoughtful layouts, and well-composed screens that reflect a high level of execution.

### Before & After Visuals
Share how your designs evolved over time. Show the "before" state and how your work improved the product experience.

### Interactive & Motion Work
Whenever possible, include high-fidelity prototypes, motion explorations, or demos that capture interaction design, usability, and the "feel" of the product in action. These pieces help convey how the product feels and behaves. Don't worry if you don't have older examples — you can create fresh ones tailored to your current skillset and the interview.

### Portfolio Assignment Tips

- **Showcase a Complex Case Study:** Include only one detailed project that demonstrates your ability to handle complexity, from discovery to execution.
- **Structure Your Presentation Clearly:** Ensure your presentation is well-organized and easy to navigate. Use a structured design process, subheadings, and summaries that highlight key points and details.
- **Go into Detail:** Include the whole design process — discovery (defining the problem), ideation, design phase (wireframes/prototypes), testing/feedback, outcome & solution, impact.
- **Demonstrate Strong UI Skills:** Apply thoughtful UI design to make your portfolio visually engaging. Focus on aesthetics, layout, and maintaining a cohesive design language.
